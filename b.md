# Guide 
This trainer was created mainy to allow the user to practive Latin verbs inflections. Each inflection (or mutation as reffered in this Triner) consisted of the root-verb and the tense-inflection. The user is given a mutation and is required to inflect it. For example for the verb "_amo_" and "_indicative active present 1st plural_", the correct inflection is _amamus_.

The correct answers were taken from Wiktionary. In several cases there is more than one attested option for inflection. For example, according to Wiktionary for "[_amo_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amo#Latin)" and "_indicative active perfect 2nd singular_" there are two options: _amavisti_ and _amasti_. The Trainer will always take the first option listed as correct. Usually, those first options also happens to be the regular.
